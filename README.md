# Cassette Flow Java GUI
A simple Java program which allows for the creation of input files for the 
Cassette Flow system built ontop the LyraT board, from MP3s stored on the local
file system.  It also integrates with the Minimodem program to encode the 
generate input file as wave files for recording onto cassette tapes, as well 
has decoding data from audio cassettes. Once decoded, the built in MP3 player 
is used to playback the file indicated by the processed data.
